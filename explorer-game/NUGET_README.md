# Remote Explorer Game
*An educational client–server exploration game for learning algorithms, libraries, and async programming.*

## What is it
Remote Explorer Game is an educational tool for learning programming, algorithms, and client–server interaction.

Students connect their own client applications (in C# or Python) to a remote game server and control agents exploring a hidden 2D map. Each agent starts at a fixed position and can move step by step until it encounters a trap and dies. Agents that remain idle for too long are automatically killed. Students can then spawn a new agent to continue exploration.

The goal is to uncover as much of the map as possible and ideally locate all traps. Multiple agents can be controlled at the same time, which introduces challenges of coordination and asynchronous programming.
